tddGPT is an autonomous coding agent that builds applications in ReactJS, Flask, Express, and more, all while adhering to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. It operates entirely without human intervention. Beginning with a project plan, tddGPT translates requirements into tests, develops code based on those tests, and debugs until all tests pass. The TDD framework keeps the agent focused and goal-oriented.

The core architecture is elegantly simple, utilizing just three tools: CLI, ReadFile, and WriteFile. It has been adpated from Langchain's AutoGPT example. Most enhancements were performed by ChatGPT Plus itself over the course of a month-long chat. The initially aim was to test the limits of GPT-4's capabilities in building ReactJS apps end-to-end. In the process, it gained an understanding of temporal concepts like past, present, and future, as well as cause and effect.

Utilizing GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4 Vision, the system is capable of transforming wireframes or screenshots, in conjunction with detailed user stories, into fully functional applications, complete with all necessary tests. The expanded context window of GPT-4 Turbo facilitates its functioning as an integrated team comprising a Product Owner, Programmer, and Tester. This enhanced capacity allows for the handling of significantly more intricate and detailed user stories.

The agent is not just a code generator; itâ€™s also a learner. It evaluates its mistakes and areas for improvement as a final step, and some of these insights have already been incorporated into its operating prompts.

This project is in early alpha stage. GPT-4 API key is required. 

## Setup Instructions

1. Setup a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv env
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
3. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/sankethchebbi/tddGPT.git

```
4. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd tddGPT
```

5. Run the following command to install the package and its dependencies:
```
python setup.py install
```

6. Set up your GPT-4 API keys as environment variables.
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

7. Run the main.py
```
cd tdd-gpt
python main.py --model gpt-4-1106-preview or gpt-3.5-turbo --prompt "Your prompt here" --temperature 0.2 --context_window 128000
```

Check the counter-app directory for the generated app.
